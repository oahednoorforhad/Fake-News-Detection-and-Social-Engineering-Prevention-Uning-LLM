This project is an intelligent system that detects fake news to help prevent social engineering attacks. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) with real-time web fact-checking to provide transparent, accurate analysis of news articles.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üß† **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses the **Gemma3** Large Language Model, run locally via **Ollama**, to analyze news content while ensuring data privacy.
* üåê **Real-Time Fact-Checking**: Implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** by fetching current web articles via the **Serper.dev API** to ground the analysis in verifiable facts.
* üîç **Transparent Reasoning**: Employs **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting to force the LLM to explain its reasoning step-by-step, making the final verdict easy to understand.
* üéØ **Confidence Scoring**: Outputs a classification ("Real" or "Fake") along with a numerical confidence score, giving users insight into the model's certainty.
* üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and interactive UI built with **Streamlit** allows for easy CSV file uploads, article selection, and clear visualization of the results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* ‚úÖ Python 3.9+
* ‚úÖ [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running.
* ‚úÖ Gemma3 model pulled via `ollama pull gemma3`
* ‚úÖ A free API key from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector-llm-rag.git](https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector-llm-rag.git)
    cd fake-news-detector-llm-rag
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```
    SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key_here"
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Start the app:**
    Make sure Ollama is running, then launch the Streamlit interface.
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2.  **Upload a CSV file** containing news articles. It must have `title` and `text` columns.
3.  **Select an article** from the dropdown menu.
4.  **Click "Analyze"** and view the verdict, confidence score, detailed reasoning, and the web sources used for fact-checking.

## üîÆ Future Work

* **Quantitative Evaluation:** Integrate labeled datasets to measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Ablation Studies:** Quantify the performance impact of RAG and CoT components.
* **Social Engineering Detection:** Add modules to specifically identify phishing indicators and persuasion techniques.
* **Model Exploration:** Test and benchmark other LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3).
* **Real-Time Integration:** Connect to live data streams like social media feeds to detect emerging campaigns.
* **Source Credibility:** Develop mechanisms to assess the reliability of retrieved web sources.
